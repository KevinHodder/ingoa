          “Ngā Ingoa o Aotearoa” (The Names of New Zealand) is literally a
          "pronouncing dictionary". More than 8000 names were spoken into a
          recorder in 1984-94 by 132 native speakers of te reo Māori, chosen by
          each other as the best speakers for their areas. Because they say only
          the names of their own areas, local accents are automatically
          accommodated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mainly elders, most of the speakers are no longer with us. Their
          voices are taonga tuku iho, treasures handed down to us. Please
          respect them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The speakers all gave of their knowledge and voices on the strict
          understanding that they should not be used for profit. In releasing
          this site to the public, I can only trust to your honour that their
          wish be respected.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dictionary was intended especially for broadcasters and those who
          have to speak in public, but everyone who wants to pronounce
          placenames authentically will find it valuable.

          The speaker's voices are the prime authority. The written names follow
          them and/or the conventions of the time so far as capitalisation,
          spacing, hyphens etc. go. (Macrons were not commonplace in 1984-94 and
          have been added.) Where the NZ Gazetteer differs, this may be noted.
        </p>
        <p>
          When speakers in or from Wʰanganui or Taranaki do not aspirate an h or
          wh, the h (or H) has been superscripted in the text. How this sounds
          varies between regions, between speakers, and by context. (For
          example, in Patea/Hawera “Hawera” vs “Te Hawera” for the same place.)
          Capitalisation of superscript h follows the usual convention, not any
          distinction of pronunciation.)

        <p>
          In Te Wai Pounamu, I italicised the k that is written and spoken
          corresponding to ng in the north, as in kai𝙠a; kainga in the north.
          (It was generally unmarked prior to that. There was a move by 𝙆ai Tahu
          to underline it in the 1990s, but this seems to have faded), In the
          same way, the southern l that stands in for northern r, and g for
          ng/k, have been italicised. Only one speaker, Huata Holmes, wanted the
          g written, though it occurs in Anglicised Māori words such as Kilmog,
          matagouri and Otago.

          They meander up the centre, west and east of the lower North Island;
          then the east, west and centre of the upper North Island; then down
          and clockwise around the South Island.

        <p>
          The Zones do not claim to correspond to rohe-a-iwi, but there is often
          a rough alignment because of the speakers' whakapapa.

          The lists include geographic features down to the larger hills and
          streams, all human settlements, suburbs and schools, marae, meeting
          houses and dining halls and many other features. It does not include
          names conferred since 1994, such as Government departments or new
          buildings. It does not give the names' meanings. That would have taken
          more than a lifetime, and would be done better by tangata whenua in
          each area.

          The dictionary was originally recorded in three parts:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Part 1: Te Upoko o te Ika (Wellington, Manawatu, Rangitikei,

              Urewera - south of a line running from the mouth of the Tarawera
              river, north of Lake Taupo, to the mouth of the Mokau river.); 59
              Zones, 2700 names, 50 speakers (4 women), , recorded October -
              November 1984, funded by a Bill Toft Memorial grant, 4000 km
              approx. travelled, launched May 1985.
            </li>
            <li>
              Part 2: Te Hiku o te Ika (Bay of Plenty, Coromandel, Hauraki, King

              speakers (12 women), recorded 1986-90 14,000 km approx. travelled,

          To a large extent, the parts have been merged to create this website,
          and the numbering of the zones – crucial to finding places on the
          cassettes and CDs - backgrounded.

          The Journeys of the Collector | Ngā Haererenga o te Kaikohi
        </h3>
        <p>
          The first germ of the dictionary was planted in 1977, when as
          Journalist in Charge at Radio Gisborne, Hugh Young asked Heni
          Sunderland to record a list of local placenames for the use of
          announcers. Then as a producer with Radio New Zealand Special Projects
          in 1983 he organised three half-day hui at Te Herenga Waka marae,
          Victoria University of Wellington, for weather forecasters to learn
          the pronunciations of the handful of Māori names then in use in
          forecasts, and issued them with cassettes of authentic pronunciations,
          spoken by Tawini Rangihau, Aroaro Hond, and Wiremu Kere Kere.
        </p>
        <p>
          That same year he applied for a Bill Toft memorial grant to record the
          names of the whole country, but was turned down. The following year
          his application was accepted. (Within seconds of the presentation, a
          non-speaker of te reo began lecturing him about the “correct”
          pronuncation of Whanganui. (“Far too much ink has been spilt and
          voices raised over the 'correct' pronunciation of WH everywhere,” he
          says. “For non-speakers of te reo a soft F will suffice and cannot
          change the him aning.” For those who care more, he recommend following
          the speakers here.)
        </p>
        <p>
          With no Internet or online Gazetteer, he gathered names from wherever
          he could, beginning with the AA Road Map. This means it will be short
          on the names of places far from roads, and the coverage of minor names
          is scattershot. The speakers themselves were invaluable in adding to
          the lists. Their memmories and his understanding may have been faulty
          in associating marae, wharenui and wharekai. Marae and houses have
          been opened and others fallen into disuse since these recordings were
          made. Since the dictionary was aimed at radio announcers, these names
          were originallymeant to be secondary to geographic features, but the
          speakers were determined that they should be comprehensive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hugh typed the first part at home on an electric typewriter, and the
          incredibly patient Radio NZ typing pool put up with his
          micromanagement for over a year. They put the lists on to 8" IBM
          floppy discs. In the first instance, he used double vowel orthography
          (eg Maaori) as he had learnt from Professor Bruce Biggs at Auckland
          University. One potential speaker refused point blank to have anything
          to do with the project if it used them. It became clear that - largely
          under the influence of Professor Tīmoti Kāretu at Waikato University -
          macrons (eg Māori) were going to win out, and they searched and
          replaced all 10 double vowels (upper and lower case AA, EE, II, OO,
          UU) with their macronned equivalents - then searched and de-macronned
          all the wrongly altered English words such as schōl and mēting.
          Creating macrons was a job in itself in those days. Each one involved
          executing a subroutine, or macro, of backspace, half-raise, hyphen,
          half-lower. When Hugh returned to the reluctant speaker with a
          macronised list, he couldn't be happier to be recorded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before he went out recording, he asked for printouts of the names, but
          invariably more would have to be added on the road. He tried to ensure
          the speakers chose each other. He asked that they have mana and te
          reo, preferably as their first language. In one case of one ideal
          candidate, it was his only language and Hugh couldn't communicate in
          sufficient detail to reach him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He tried to insure that women were included, but they often proved
          reticent, despite being the better speakers. One influential contact
          insisted that only children of her late father could say the local
          names, but none of them spoke te reo. In the event she settled for a
          cousin, who was excellent. Often the best speakers were shy, while the
          less suitable ones pushed themselves forward. Hugh learnt much about
          diplomacy on his travels, and the gentle ways of saying “No.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The first volume was entirely recorded on a portable reel-to-reel
          recorder. From the outset Hugh insisted on using the only stereo
          recorder of Radio NZ Special Projects, when it was free. (Fortunately
          Special Projects, broadcasting in AM, recorded in stereo only
          occasionally.) He knew that the sound quality would be substantially
          better in stereo, even though it was only ever a single voice. He made
          various short forays to southern parts of the North Island, and two
          big sweeps over several days into Wʰanganui, Taranaki, Taupo, the
          Urewera, East Coast and Hawkes Bay.
        </p>
        <p>
          He encountered occasional resistance to the project, sometimes
          explicitly because he was a Pākehā, but mainly enthusiasm and
          boundless hospitality. The blessings and voices of previous speakers
          mellted resistance, especially once they included such famous names as
          John Rangihau, Wiremu Parker, Bill Kere Kere, Ruka Broughton, Eruera
          Manuera, Tupi Puriri, and Matenga Baker.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hugh drew the covers of the booklets, the first especially, in
          day-long bursts of creativity, the North Island ones especially
          including many local references.

        <p>
          He can't believe he completed recording and publishing the first part
          in only 18 months while holding down a full-time job. It was launched
          at Takapuwahia Marae by Rino Tirikatene (Snr).
        </p>
        <p>
          Without a grant for the second part, he could no longer rely on the
          Radio NZ typing pool, and created the lists at home, teaching himself
          how to use a computer and databases, which were relatively new in
          1986. (A “Superscript” word processor and “Superbase” database in a
          Commodore 128 home computer.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the second volume was recorded on the Uher portable
          reel-to-reel machine, but at one point north of Auckland it broke down
          and he hired what had once been a top-of-the-line cassette machine, a
          Nakimichi. The sound quality, even though it had Dolby noise
          reduction, was decidedly inferior. He completed the thermal region by
          1988 and presented one copy to Radio NZ in Rotorua. He made several
          long hauls into the King Country, Waikato-Hauraki, Auckland and
          Northland in 1989-1990.
        </p>
        <p>
          Invaluable throughout Tainui was a letter from the secretary to Te
          Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu giving her blessing to the project.
          And he especially remember the hospitality of Raureti and Bob Harris
          of Kohukohu, who invited him to stay the night after recording them,
          help himself to breakfast and let himself out in the morning, while
          they were out milking cows and driving the school bus.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the time Part 2 was completed in 1991, Radio NZ was unsupportive
          and this volume was launched discreetly at his home by Bill Kere Kere.
        </p>
        <p>
          His first port of call when he embarked on the South Island was (later
          Sir) Tīpene O'Regan, who immediately referred him to Dr Maarire
          Goodall, and he became a dear friend. He was invaluable, with contacts
          all over Te Waipounamu.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hugh was in Christchurch making his first South Island contacts in
          1991 when he learnt that he had been made redundant from Radio NZ. He
          determined to carry on, and gained two grants through Internal
          Affairs, from the Lottery Grants Board Culture and Heritage fund and
          the Pacific Conservation and Development Trust, which is funded from
          the French Government's grant of $13 million in recognition of (not
          "compensation for") the sinking of the "Rainbow Warrior". Much of that
          went on a Digital Audio Tape (DAT) recorder, and the third volume was
          entirely recorded on it. The improvement in sound quality is evident.

          He visited the South Island three times altogether, travelling as far
          as Tākaka, Hokitika and Tuatāpere. Again he created the lists at home,
          but this time he transmitted them to Dr Goodall's computer using a
          standalone modem and a precursor of the Internet, a dialup dating
          service called theMeetboard. At 300 Baud (bits/second), that took
          hours, and the issues of encoding and decoding the macrons in ASCII
          were horrendous. The third volume was launched at Tapu te Ranga Marae
          in 1994, by his friend Richard Northey MP, among others.

          People often said “You should have done this years ago when Mea Te Mea
          was alive.” He's very glad that he did do it all those years ago, when
          so many great speakers - many first-language speakers, some
          pre-television, some even pre-radio - were alive. Te mita o te reo
          (intonation and accent) has certainly changed since 1984-94.

          It was in the back of Hugh Young's mind, as some kind of science
          fiction dream, that some day one could hear any of the names instantly
          at the touch of a button. He had no idea, when every computer had a
          room to itself, that a man in Rwanda or Uganda could make that happen
          for him while they talked, or that then anyone in the world could hear
          those same names at the touch of that same virtual button.

          Hugh Young (Pākehā, Clan Chatten) was born in Christchurch when Māori
          there were almost invisible, and after graduating in Zoology from
          Canterbury University, worked in Auckland, Whāngarei and Gisborne as a
          journalist with the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation, later Radio
          New Zealand, and then in Wellington as a producer. He began studying
          Māori almost accidentally at Auckland University under Professor Bruce
          Biggs and Merimeri Penfold in 1969, when few Pākehā did, and the
          linguistic and social landscape was very different. A friend, Murray
          Short invited him to Ruātoki and introduced him to Ngāi Tūhoe, John
          Rangihau took him under his wing and he competed at two Tūhoe
          Festivals in the back row of Tūhoe ki Pōneke. He also has a connection
          to Parihaka, unveiling Whatarau Wharehoka's headstone in 1973, and in
          1981 helping prepare for the centenary of te Rā o te Pāhua. As a VSA
          volunteer in Solomon Islands in 1974-6, he co-authored a dictionary
          and grammar of Solomon Islands Pijin. Although has no whakapapa Māori
          himself, he now has mokopuna of Tūhoe, and whanaunga of Ngāti Porou,
          descent.

          Most of the North Island names were recorded on a Uher Report Monitor
          4200 portable stereo reel-to-reel recorder at 7 ½ in/sec using two
          SM-58 microphones, except for the voice of Hemi Konore, on a Nakimichi
          stereo cassette recorder. The South Island was recorded on a Sony
          TCD-D3 Walkman DAT recorder with a Sony ECM-S220 electret condenser
          stereo microphone. A vertical aspect was included in the microphone
          placement for the benefit of any future vocal analysis.

          The tapes of Parts 1 and 2 were edited by splicing copies of the
          masters, then copied again – at 15 ips to minimise degradation. The
          digital tapes were roughly edited with two Tascam DA-30 recorders,
          then finely with Mac Protocols. The first three tracks required one
          analogue transcription. The spliced master tapes and the DAT are held
          by Ngā Taonga Sound and Vision. The three parts were issued on pairs
          of cassettes, later on pairs of CDs, with accompanying booklets,
          naming the speakers and defining the places named. They were later
          united into a website, ingoa.nz, searchable only by Zone/takiwā, but
          with some common names playable separately.

          Ā, he aha ta Ihowa e rapu nei ki a koe?
          <br /> Heoi anō, ko te whakawā tika,
          <br /> ko te pai ki te tohu tangata,
          <br /> ko te whakaiti me te haere tahi i tōu Atua.

          I have not always taken their advice; sometimes experts disagreed;
          sometimes I will have asked the wrong questions; and the final
          responsibility for all mistakes is mine.

          Mark Honeychurch created the database from which this website draws
          its data, including the timings of the start and finish of each name,
          and remastered the audio. It was Kevin Hodder (in Rwanda and Uganda)
          who created the convenient site you see. I have been greatly supported
          in bringing the site to this stage by Professor Peter Adds and Paul
          Edwards of Te Herenga Waka/Victoria University of Wellington,
          Vicki-Anne Heikell and Paul Diamond of the Alexander Turnbull Library,
          my friends Lance Gunderson and Mark Masterson, and most of all by my
          devoted husband, Tim Bish-Young. Ngā mihi aroha ki ā koutou katoa.
